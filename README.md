# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of Project

In this challenge I refactored code to loop through all the data in order to collect total daily volume and percent return for specific stocks. Then, I determined whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Lastly, I created a written analysis that explains my findings.

### Purpose

To find out whether the code ran faster after being refactored.

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient or improving the logic to make it easier for future users to read.


## Results

Refactoring should increase effectiveness and improve logic; in this case it stands true. 

When running the code before refactoring 2017 and 2018 ran in .7773438 and .7773438 seconds respectively.

After refactoring, 2017 and 2018 ran in .125 and .09375 respectively.

Therefore, even with a relatively small dataset refactoring can make a huge difference in how fast the program runs which can save precious time in the work environment. 


## Summary

Even though refactoring will take time, the time spent reviewing, examining and overhauling the code can potentially save hundreds of hours over a years’ time and can possibly retain a client or two.

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring Code?
One clear advantage is the run time of the code. With a dataset that is thousands of rows long and hundreds of rows wide refactoring can save time by speeding up the run process.

One clear disadvantage is you have to visit the code on more than one occasion. We are all human and can’t get things right the first time so we will need to revisit the code potentially 5 to 10 times in order to get the results we are looking for.
